# Pentest Cheat Sheet

Hello Everyone,  

I worked as a Penetration Tester for 3 years in global company. I have experience in Web Application Pentest, Mobile Application Pentest, Internal Pentest. I have been working as an independent bug bounty hunter for about 4 years. I decided to compile the resources, tools and notes I used during the pentests. I will share them here and update as I get new informations, tips and tricks. I hope it will be useful for you too!




### ****XSS payloads and XSS bypass methods****

You can find in here the XSS payloads that I used most and were successful during pentests. I also include the bypass and encode methods I use. It is very useful for bypassing the ASCII table in `XSS-bypass-methods.md`. 



### ***Tools and Exploits***

You can find in here the tools, burp extensions and exploit methods I use.
