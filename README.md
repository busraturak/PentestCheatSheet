# Pentest Cheat Sheet

Hello Everyone,  

I worked as a Penetration Tester for 3 years in global company. I have experience in Web Application Pentest, Mobile Application Pentest, Internal Pentest. I have been working as an independent bug bounty hunter for about 4 years. I decided to compile the resources, tools and notes I used during the pentests. I will share them here and update as I get new informations, tips and tricks. I hope it will be useful for you too!
